# DevOps Learning Journey on GCP, GKE, Terraform & Workload Identity

This repository documents my structured learning journey
through core DevOps topics using real implementations on
Google Cloud, GKE Autopilot, Terraform, IAM, and Workload Identity.

Each level contains:
- What I learned
- What questions I asked
- What steps I executed
- How I validated the work
- What challenges I faced during implementation
  
## Levels Completed
1. Level 1 – Terraform basics + kubeconfig provider
2. Level 2 – Local Helm chart deployment
3. Level 3 – Google Service Account impersonation
4. Level 4 – Workload Identity (KSA ↔ GSA binding)
5. Level 5 - CI Terraform
6. Level 6 - Github Action OICD
7. Level 7 - OIDC Restriction & Entreprise level restriction
8. Level 8 - Terraform Apply on Merge (Full Infra CI/CD)
