# Level 2 – Local Helm Chart Deployment via Terraform

In this level I learned how to build and deploy a local Helm chart instead of
using a remote repository. I created a simple chart, added templates and values,
and configured Terraform to point to a local filesystem chart.

This taught me how Helm packaging works, how Terraform loads charts locally,
and how to control deployment with custom values.
