# Level 1 – Terraform Basics and First Kubernetes Deployment

In this level I learned how to use Terraform to interact with Google Cloud and
deploy basic infrastructure resources. I set up the Google provider, configured
kubeconfig for Terraform, and deployed a simple Helm chart using Terraform.

This was my first working deployment on GKE Autopilot. I learned how Terraform
initializes, plans, applies changes, and connects to the Kubernetes cluster.
