# Level 7 – Questions I Asked

- Do we actually need to restrict the provider to a single repo?
- Where is my GitHub username/repo used in the OIDC configuration?
- Can we reuse the existing identity pool instead of recreating it?
- How do I safely update the attribute condition without breaking auth?
- How do I know if the restriction worked or blocked my workflow?
